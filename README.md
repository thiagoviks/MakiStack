# MakiStack

A from-scratch scientific computing ecosystem in Zig combining arrays, dataframes, SQL-like queries, visualization, and AI experiments into a single high-performance stack.

From my C projects.



## 🚀 Overview

MakiStack is a modular scientific computing framework built in Zig.  
It is inspired by tools like NumPy, Pandas, SQL engines, and lightweight machine learning libraries.

The goal is to explore systems programming while rebuilding core data science and AI abstractions from scratch with full control over memory, performance, and architecture.



## 🧩 Modules

MakiStack is organized into independent components:

- **ndarray** → n-dimensional arrays and numerical operations  
- **dataframe** → column-based tabular data structure  
- **sql** → lightweight SQL-like query engine  
- **plot** → visualization and charting tools  
- **ai** → machine learning experiments (gradient descent, models)  
- **db** → simple database layer  
- **scizig** → scientific utilities and glue layer

### 🎯 Goals
Rebuild scientific computing tools from scratch
Understand memory layout and performance deeply
Explore AI/ML algorithms at low level
Build a unified ecosystem in Zig
Replace high-level abstractions with controlled systems

### 🧠 Philosophy

This project is not just a library.

It is a systems-level reconstruction of data science tools, designed to understand how frameworks like NumPy, Pandas, and SQL engines actually work under the hood.

### 📌 Status

Work in progress — experimental systems stack.
